     <h1>Smells like teen spirit - <small> Nirvana </small></h1> 

    <h2>Le Groupe</h2> 

   <p><strong>Nirvana</strong> Nirvana was an American alternative rock band. They were one of the most successful and influential bands of that time. Since they formed, they have sold over 75 million records all over the world. They played a style of rock music known as grunge, which was highly influenced by 1980s alternative rock, 1970s punk, and heavy metal. Grunge became more commercially successful than the previous punk rock, as promoted to the world by Sub Pop Records. Nirvana greatly affected the style of other grunge bands such as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. They split up after their lead singer Kurt Cobain died in 1994 after he committed suicide. On April 10, 2014, Nirvana received a star in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. </p> 

     <h2> Les Paroles <h2/> 

      <p> Load up on guns <br/>
      Bring your friends <br/>
    It's fun to lose and to pretend <br/>
    She's overboard, self assured <br/>
    Oh no I know, a dirty word </p>

    <p>Hello, hello, hello, how low [x3]<br/>
    Hello, hello, hello </p>


    <p>With the lights out, it's less dangerous <br/>
    Here we are now, entertain us <br/>
    I feel stupid and contagious <br/>
    Here we are now, entertain us <br/>
    A mulatto, an Albino <br/>
    A mosquito, my libido, yeah </p>

    <p>
    Hey, yay
    </p>

    <p> I'm worse at what I do best <br/>
    And for this gift, I feel blessed <br/>
    Our little group has always been <br/>
    And always will until the end</p>

    <p>Hello, hello, hello, how low [x3]<br/>
    Hello, hello, hello <br/>
    With the lights out, it's less dangerous<br/>
    Here we are now, entertain us <br/>
    I feel stupid and contagious <br/>
    Here we are now, entertain us <br/>
    A mulatto, an Albino <br/>
    A mosquito, my libido, yeah </p> 

   <p>
   Hey, yay
   </p>

   <p>
   And I forget just why I taste<br/>
   Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile <br/>
   I found it hard, it was hard to find <br/>
   Oh well, whatever, nevermind </p>
   
   <p>
   Hello, hello, hello, how low [x3] <br/>
   Hello, hello, hello <br/>
   </p>

   <p>
   With the lights out, it's less dangerous <br/>
   Here we are now, entertain us <br/>
   I feel stupid and contagious <br/>
   Here we are now, entertain us <br/>
   A mulatto, an Albino <br/>
   A mosquito, my libido</p>
